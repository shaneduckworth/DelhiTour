The Ashokan pillars are inscriptions by various kings encouraging kingdom citizens and future generations in moral, just, and righteous behaviour.</string>

    <string name="restaurants1_desc">North Indian, South Indian, and Chinese cuisine.</string>
    <string name="restaurants2_desc">The best samosas and jalebi, made fresh in Delhi.  Gupta is there during these hours, but samosas start selling at 5 pm on the button.  Given him a few minutes to pray and thank God for the sales of the samosas and jelabi, then the fun begins!</string>

    <string name="getting1_desc">Quintessential travel in India.  To not have at least one train experience in India would be almost missing the whole point.  Leaving always on time but rarely arriving as intended, the journey is nonetheless the preferred means of travel:  No traffic.  No horns.  No jackhammers.  No potholes.  No sudden stops and starts.</string>
    <string name="getting2_desc">Almost as iconic as the Indian Railways, a trip to Delhi is incomplete without at least one ride on Gupta\'s rickshaw.  These guys are very cheap, they know the best routes, and can maneuver through gnarly traffic relatively effortlessly.  You will always want to tip these guys because they work extremely hard to get you to your destination.</string>
    <string name="getting3_desc">Redbus has become the default booking app for bus transportation in India.  You can get cheaper, local transportation at the bus stands, but this is a great way to ensure you have a ticket for your next departure or return.</string>
    <string name="getting4_desc">Jet Airways is a home-grown low-cost Indian airline that flies through most major centers in India, and has a significant international presence as well, thanks to contracts with other major carriers.</string>

    <string name="hotels2_desc">A palatial five-star hotel in south Delhi that will definitely pamper you during your stay in Delhi.</string>
    <string name="hotels3_desc">Located in Nanak Pura in west Delhi, this typical upper-scale but simple hotel offers a complimentary breakfast with room booking.</string>
    <string name="hotels4_desc">Jugaad is a favourite Indian word more or less equivalent to the North American \'duct tape and baling wire\', meaning anything fixed probably has an element of innovation and \'this will hold for awhile\' attitude.  Jugaad Hostels is a very pleasant and fun place for the backpacker crowd.</string>
